This week, I only had a few notable uses of AI, one of the being chatGPT, where I asked it to create a study plan for a certification I
am trying to get. I think this is one the most "practical" uses of AI, where youre not actually asking for it to provide you with any profound
knowledge, but rather using it to do tasks which require complex orginization, things that have lots of components which would be difficult
for a human brain to process and piece all together. this is my chat with it: https://chatgpt.com/c/68c73d7b-dd54-832c-ba51-9ed1a1f8f49c
